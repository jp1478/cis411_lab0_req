## 1. Overview

![Use Case Diagram](/assets/Use_Case_Diagram.pdf)  

The business problem that this project aims to solve is that students and staff 
want to be able to have food made and delivered on campus. This involves a customer placing an order, 
a cook making the food, and a delivery person to bring the food to its destination. 
The software needs to allow the customer to send a ticket to the cook that includes the food item and any relevant properties 
as well as a destination and name. The customer will automatically be charged to their selected payment method. 


## 2. Requirements
In this section, organize and list requirements from *Step 5*.  You are welcome to organize this section in anyway that you would like (using headings or tables).  The structure of this section should correspond to your overview section, and it is recommended that that you review the [lessons learned](../lessonsLearned.md) from your colleagues.
